abstract = {Large-scale problems of engineering and scientific computing often require solutions of eigenvalue and related problems. This book gives a unified overview of theory, algorithms, and practical software for eigenvalue problems. The material is accessible for the first time to experts as well as many nonexpert users who need to choose the best state-of-the-art algorithms and software for their problems. Using an informal decision tree, just enough theory is introduced to identify the relevant mathematical structure that determines the best algorithm for each problem. The algorithm “leaves” of the decision tree range from the classical QR algorithm, which is most suitable for small dense matrices, to iterative algorithms for very large generalized eigenvalue problems. Algorithms are presented in a unified style as templates, with different levels of detail suitable for readers ranging from beginning students to experts.},

The resulting algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the symmetric Lanczos algorithm with partial reorthogonalization (PRO) developed by Simon, but works directly on the Lanczos bidiagonalization of A. For computing the singular values and vectors of a large sparse matrix with high accuracy, the BPRO algorithm uses only half the amount of storage and a factor of 3-4 less work compared to methods based on PRO applied to an equivalent symmetric system. Like PRO, the algorithm presented here is based on simple recurrences, which enable it to monitor the loss of orthogonality among the Lanczos vectors directly without forming inner products. These recurrences are used to develop a Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm with partial reorthogonalization, which has been implemented in a MATLAB package for sparse SVD and...},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a restarted variant of the Lanczos method for symmetric eigenvalue problems named the thick-restart Lanczos method. This new variant is able to retain an arbitrary number of Ritz vectors from the previous iterations with a minimal restarting cost. Since it restarts with Ritz vectors, it is simpler than similar methods, such as the implicitly restarted Lanczos method. We carefully examine the effects of the floating-point round-off errors on stability of the new algorithm and present an implementation of the partial reorthogonalization scheme that guarantees accurate Ritz values with a minimal amount of reorthogonalization. We also show a number of heuristics on deciding which Ritz pairs to save during restart in order to maximize the overall performance of the thick-restart Lanczos method.},

@article{Lehoucq1996,
abstract = {A deflation procedure is introduced that is designed to improve the convergence of an implicitly restarted Arnoldi iteration for computing a few eigenvalues of a large matrix. As the iteration progresses, the Ritz value approximations of the eigenvalues converge at different rates. A numerically stable scheme is introduced that implicitly deflates the converged approximations from the iteration. We present two forms of implicit deflation. The first, a locking operation, decouples converged Ritz values and associated vectors from the active part of the iteration. The second, a purging operation, removes unwanted but converged Ritz pairs. Convergence of the iteration is improved and a reduction in computational effort is also achieved. The deflation strategies make it possible to compute multiple or clustered eigenvalues with a single vector restart method. A block method is not required. These schemes are analyzed with respect to numerical stability, and computational results are presented.},
