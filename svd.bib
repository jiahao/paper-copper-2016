	Abstract = {Lanczos bidiagonalization is a competitive method for computing a partial singular value decompo- sition of a large sparse matrix, that is, when only a subset of the singular values and corresponding singular vectors are required. However, a straightforward implementation of the algorithm has the problem of loss of orthogonality between computed Lanczos vectors, and some reorthogonalization technique must be applied. Also, an effective restarting strategy must be used to prevent excessive growth of the cost of reorthogonalization per iteration. On the other hand, if the method is to be implemented on a distributed-memory parallel computer, then additional precau- tions are required so that parallel efficiency is maintained as the number of processors increases. In this paper, we present a Lanczos bidiagonalization procedure implemented in SLEPc, a software library for the solution of large, sparse eigenvalue problems on parallel computers. The solver is numerically robust and scales well up to hundreds of processors.},

@article{Golub1965,
	Abstract = {A numerically stable and fairly fast scheme is described to compute the unitary matrices U and V which transform a given matrix A into a diagonal form \$\backslash Sigma = U\^{} * AV\$, thus exhibiting A's singular values on \$\backslash Sigma \$'s diagonal. The scheme first transforms A to a bidiagonal matrix J, then diagonalizes J. The scheme described here is complicated but does not suffer from the computational difficulties which occasionally afflict some previously known methods. Some applications are mentioned, in particular the use of the pseudo-inverse \$A\^{}I = V\backslash Sigma \^{}I U\^{}* \$ to solve least squares problems in a way which dampens spurious oscillation and cancellation.},
